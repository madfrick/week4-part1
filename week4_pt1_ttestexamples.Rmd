```

## 1. Confidence intervals

```{r}
otter_length <- c(38, 41, 50, 27, 37, 32, 42, 60, 43)

t.test(otter_length) #the t-test is testing against the null hypothesis that the mean length is 0
```

## T-test (1-sample t-test)

See a claim: mean otter length is 50 inches

```{r}
otter_test <- t.test(x = otter_length, mu = 50)
otter_test
```

## Two-sample t-test
```{r}
desert_bighorns <- c(32, 44, 18, 26, 50, 33, 42, 20)
sierra_bighorns <- c(28, 31, 40, 42, 26, 29, 31)

t.test(x = desert_bighorns, y = sierra_bighorns)
```
